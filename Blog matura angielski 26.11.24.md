I'm super excited to announce my band's first concert!
We chose to perform at the \[name] club in Warsaw, as the staff there has treated us wonderfully and allowed us to customize everything we needed.
We still have a lot of work to do before the performance, for example, we need to set up some elaborate decorations for the stage.
Personally, I'm quite stressed out about the concert because so many things could go wrong, but I'm trying my best to stay positive.
We all hope that this will be the start of a new chapter in the band's history, we'd like to visit many other cities in Poland before the end of the year. After that, we'll focus on a new album.
The tickets are selling out quickly, so get yours while they're available!
See you there!
